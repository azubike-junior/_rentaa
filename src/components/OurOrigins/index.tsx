            <p className="font-dm-sans text-xs lg:text-xl font-normal text-center max-w-6xl">We started in September 2021 with one goal in mind; to disrupt the p2p gadget lending space in Nigeria. Our work since then has been a testament to that fact.</p>
            <p className="font-dm-sans text-xs lg:text-xl font-normal text-center max-w-6xl">Having identified a problem of e-waste management in Nigeria as well as rising costs of gadgets, we decided to solve that problem by creating a platform with our users at the centre of it. Our sole focus is in how best we can serve this ripe market in Nigeria and make a world of difference in the process.</p>
